<p>
<span>When I do see a clock that shows it's noon,</span>
<span>my stomach growls with zeal of a baboon.</span>
<span>I hurry t'ward the kitchen pantry quick.</span>
<span>What can be mixed? I do arithmetic.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>To curb hunger, there is one choice: a wrap.</span>
<span>Multigrain, local! What could be better?</span>
<span>Inside: turkey, bacon, lettuce, and more.</span>
<span>All sealed via searing, wrapped up tight.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>I savor every bite, no time to nap.</span>
<span>This certainly will be a trend-setter.</span>
<span>Beware: the mustard leaks, it's on the floor.</span>
<span>Not long, it's gone. Like life, wraps are finite.</span>
