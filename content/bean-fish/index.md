Move over the phrase "peas in a pod," there's a new grouping in town: "beans and a fish." Oh, if only that were the case. The world will instead go on with fish served adjacent to french fries, a taco, or some kind of salad. After spending some time on the other side I have come away with some understanding, that perhaps this match was not meant to be.
