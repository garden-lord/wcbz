There comes a time in every man, woman and childs' life when they must make a tough decision. Especially in these trying times, you will commonly find french fries, tater tots, potato wedges, and even fritters in your own home. Usually these sides are confined to restaurants and fast food establishments, where the proprietors have the necessary equipment to make decent fried potato foods. At home, there's not much to do with these sides. Often the entre√© takes center stage, causing you to end up with an abundance of leftover fries. Herein lies the decision: do you eat, and possibly gorge on these fries, potentially making yourself sick? Or do you save the fries in the refrigerator, and eat a soggy, grainy potato mess the next day?

It's nearly impossible to revive refrigerated french fries to their former glory. The leftover potato medley is one of the few ways to get these 'taters to an edible state. It requires a few ingredients: some cheese, some greens, and (if you can afford it) some meats. Toss all those babies together, then toss that mixture into the toaster oven for a few minutes. At the end, the fries and tots won't be quite as crisp as before, but with meager equipment they can be brought to a decent state. They don't call it "Potatoes Medley," after all; it's leftovers.

Similar skills are required to make the [Nacho Mountain](/nachos). One must evenly distribute the cheese and meats to all the fries in order to disguise the refrigerated potato texture. But with some help from a little barbecue sauce, these fries get a second wind, and a new lease at life. The next time you are thinking about throwing those day-old fries straight into the garbage can, remember the leftover potato medley.
