                        <p>&ldquo;Nugget&rdquo; descends from the mid 1800s word &ldquo;nug,&rdquo; which means lump. Gold, chicken, and even turkey have been shaped into nugget form, but until recent times, the general public has not accepted fish-based nuggets. Here we will consider salmon nuggets: salmon cut into small pieces with 90 degree angles, dipped in egg, flour, and breadcrumbs, and then fried.</p>
<p>You can bake a salmon, you can pan-sear a salmon, you can even eat it raw! But there is always room to spice things up a little, and here salmon nuggets fill that vacancy nicely. The closest relative to the salmon nugget is the fish stick. There are some crucial differences between the two, however. A fish stick is a far cry from a fish nugget, with one dimension dwarfing the others. A nugget is more equal on all axes, especially a salmon nugget which lends itself easily to a nugget with square angles. Secondly, fish sticks typically use white fish, a category which does not include salmon. While they may seem similar on the surface, a fish stick dish and a salmon nugget differ in many aspects.</p>

<p>Since the fish is a little on the blander side of things, you could accompany it with ketchup or some other kind of dipping sauce. As always, it&rsquo;s important to follow the USDA&rsquo;s recommended food plate and get some fruits and vegetables to be with your salmon &lsquo;nugs. Here I have a smattering of broccoli along with some store-branch applesauce to complete the meal.</p>
