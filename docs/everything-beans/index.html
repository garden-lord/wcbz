                        <p>This is a little concoction of mine I discovered not long ago. Combine a microwaved can of black beans (specifically S&amp;W Organic Black Beans in an 8 pack from Costco) with some Trader Joe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend&rdquo; and you get something heretofore unheard of.</p>
<p>It is no secret that the popularity of beans in general is on an upward trend. Google shows searches steadily yet staunchly increasing over time; it&rsquo;s no meteoric rise, but slow and steady wins the race. This is manifesting throughout all facets of nutritional life. For instance, <a href="https://usdrybeans.com/2019/02/20/looking-ahead-beans-in-food-aid-2019/">according to the U.S. Dry Bean Council</a>, over 10 million kilograms of beans were shipped to schools in 2019 alone. Even in these lean times, the bean industry is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-beans-sales.html">thriving</a> with record sales as people stock their shelves with the essentials.</p>


<div class="centerer-flex"><img src="/everything-beans/trend.jpg" alt="Beans"></div>
<p>Just as a tool is useless without purpose, a bean, dry or canned, is of little use languishing on a shelf. A tool also requires a competent operator to be most effective, and beans are no different. To truly maximize the utility per bean ratio, constant innovations and adjustments are required. From this ethos, &ldquo;everything beans&rdquo; were born. They combine the heartiness of microwaved beans that millions have come to know and love with an unfamiliar, but welcome, change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend&rdquo; (technically named &ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend With Sea Salt, Garlic, &amp; Onion&rdquo;) is a spice blend from Trader Joe&rsquo;s containing sesame seeds, sea salt, dried minced garlic, black sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. In short, everything you would find on an everything bagel. Or is it? According to <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/gfc_2013_13_4_51.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArkwggK1BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKmMIICogIBADCCApsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM_Qoc1S74NuIJn_wOAgEQgIICbO5yjYuIrJtw2IGLn0_YTZMrR2ytyY-TV7ZQGG7DmnpYOmnvAugMc9n10H9_56q3kScfHd5rMGo3LB3EBNQ2mt7P66r5iYwknHpoes_utExH2la1NF5ARU890hZSG3rcdA3uohKpYgy6PyLr797e1YWgx_buO5fbY9T7_FMuUfI-H8u1dokdxJk2vZX853cCiRPE8LN_1K01iVfi3EwRPyEgwVhEgHlUomBKVfb7XxgzIY5p4hexHZrnh2G6le1ld93ORSDJBmOKanI5c6y2kK2eZwVvJzmNEcxOg9TEn_kAD5jA3de5sFj5TUIU2V495I_JwEdHWqk5tpmPtYII5xnCbDsCJ6E3pQGnt1VAd00YKZ8nP6AHoeTKr-__HWOJtrI5zGNKEVtnRlL1WC1DeGMPiuAdaiPMr9MYHt2Q0EOxwD94CUbrtR15h6Yi_jencE_vLZms7G35L7ds3n7ZbkFgBECmmAU4cUkZiSd4NXYpPPiCKxudtkj1taR4mN57JNduEmLF0dfam7VrnQl9ZNqXeY2yEAv0WRf_E4c_iWtLgnrBU0cUZ1MYm4xVua0y_jrk-qj3MIowKem8H5zbLxVmCbsRWHEGB6d51er2c_xX0cmXgtXh5tQ1Q30o8eodBngFRisSSps-1KjYC9aBRzy6PqqeHPmFFAZZsPqxcZ6qXwANw_h4JnexDHqJqZ_Nj1LaknoXTxMX9tlq0obgYXCRb9htGu0aHT-m-KK7YeY9BqeF-KKeiMa53s80uMHG5ywd6kMTzqA-kNWcHb4iEjffsmmch3hOU-kvXPKzlCFm3tdupTGoaDz6mbls">this publication</a>, a typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_bagel">everything bagel</a> will include all of the listed spices. However, there is the matter of the curious case of caraway (also known as meridian fennel). Some sources casually list it as an ingredient to be lumped in with the others. A vocal minority <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/talk/2010/11/what-belongs-on-an-everything-bagel.html">vehemently opposes</a> its addition. I find myself in the latter category, as a childhood aversion to black licorice has morphed into a full distaste for everything even remotely fennel. Given the debate around the topic, it was prudent of Trader Joe to exclude it from this spice blend. Therefore the labeling on the package appears to be accurate, to any reasonable assertion of &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interplay of the beans and &ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend&rdquo; brings forward notes of many other bean toppings, but with a distinct flavor of its own. A base comparison would be to black beans seasoned with plain sesame seeds. Between the two, the dried garlic puts the everything beans head and shoulders above its competition. Next, an oriental twist: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furikake">furikake</a>. Furikake beans are dominated by the taste of the roasted seaweed, with the sesame seeds taking a backseat (be careful to completely strain your beans before seasoning them, as excess water will quickly turn the seaweed soggy). Everything beans stand as a new contender in the world of microwaved bean toppings, but it is a formidable one. The mass appeal of the &ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend&rdquo; makes what some would consider a bland bowl of beans into a delightful snack. I am no different, thusly I rate the everything beans as a firm &ldquo;give it a try.&rdquo;</p>
