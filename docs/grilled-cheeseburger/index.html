                        <p>Coming in hot off the press, it&rsquo;s a fresh take on the tired old grilled cheese. Before you say it&rsquo;s just a patty melt, take a closer look! The orange-yellow tinge granted by the cheese layer gives the sandwich a welcoming hue in the right lighting. The burger patty adds a hearty heft, giving the sandwich a nice weight in ones hand. A thin layer of hardened cheese encrusts the outer side of each bread, making this dish toe the line into &ldquo;grilled cheese&rdquo; territory.</p>


<div class="centerer-flex"><img src="burger.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The patty&rsquo;s tough and disturbingly uniform texture harkens back to days long past in primary school cafeterias. Cooked through completely from top to bottom, it assumes a dull grey that warns onlookers of its perpetual dryness. You may be wondering how such a patty could be redeemed, but you need only look to the cheese above and below it. Prepared in a freezer for several months, the cheese has acquired a sogginess that by itself would also deter potential eaters. But combined with the burger patty, the two achieve an equilibrium and work together to bring both to an acceptable level.</p>


<div class="centerer-flex"><img src="cooking.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p>The world of cheese-carb dishes is a tough one to break into. Mac and cheese is a the top of the pyramid, and even the tried-and-true grilled cheese is very popular. The patty melt is more underground and more raw in a way that plain old mac and cheese could never hope to be. These castes have historically been rigid and fixed, and generally accepted by society as a whole. However, the grilled cheeseburger cracks this entire social fabric wide open, failing to be confined to a single category. It&rsquo;s not quite a revolution, but the undercurrents of disruption are beginning to flow strong.</p>
