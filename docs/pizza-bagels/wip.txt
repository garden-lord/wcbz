Everybody and their mother is talking about [Bagel Bites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_Bites) these days. I'm tired of it! Bagel Bites are overdone, overpriced, and they always underdeliver. Things like that have no place in a home pantry, let alone a grocery store aisle. Today the superior full-sized [Pizza Bagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_bagel) venture into our hearts and minds as the only legitimate bagel-based pizza spin off.

The Pizza Bagel, invented in the 1970s, adds an extra boost to the typical pizza crust.
