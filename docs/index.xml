      <description>The Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s frozen dessert section draws a large crowd daily. People clamor for mochi ice cream, both miniature and regular sized in between swiping pints of esoteric ice cream flavors.</description>

      <description>For those that frequent a certain type of ethnic barbeque, cheese corn is a fan favorite. Imagine: cheese and corn mixed together. My mouth is watering already, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t even talked about the mayonnaise!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Leggo my eggo&amp;rdquo; rings out from elementary school cafeterias to auto-playing TVs in a Walmart electronics section. But where are the eggs? Aside from the &amp;ldquo;breakfast for dinner&amp;rdquo; trend, it&amp;rsquo;s all pancakes and waffles and stuffed pancake bites.</description>

      <description>Every bean has a simple dream: to grow and mature in the sweet sunshine of mother nature, be picked by a Ploeger BP2140E self-propelled bean picker, shucked, cooked, canned in a pool of their own juice, packaged in a group of eight, shipped to a Costco, sold to a scrupulous consumer, microwaved for one minute, salted, and eaten from a bowl.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Wagyu&amp;rdquo; in Japanese is 和牛 which means &amp;ldquo;Japanese cow,&amp;rdquo; which is where Wagyu beef comes from. Wagyu cows were invented in the old times, from a specialization of the East Asian aurochs that found their way across the sea.</description>

      <description>A twist on the classic &amp;ldquo;chicken and waffles,&amp;rdquo; this Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s Frozen Chicken Pot Pie combines chicken and bread in a most unusual way. Suspended in a slurry of peas and carrots, a series of cubed, dense chicken bits float around.</description>

      <description>Every child dreams of waking up on Christmas morning to a nice hearty bowl of mac and cheese. Unfortunately, a garden-variety boxed mac and cheese doesn&amp;rsquo;t have anywhere near the protein levels that a growing boy or girl needs, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to improvise.</description>

      <description>The cookie is a veritable swiss army knife of desserts. Though it provides some playful constraints, these conspire to create a platform that inspires creativity.

      <description>Everybody and their mother is talking about Bagel Bites these days. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of it! Bagel Bites are overdone, overpriced, and they always underdeliver. Things like that have no place in a home pantry, let alone a grocery store aisle.</description>

      <description>If there was ever a time to play it safe with a meal, it&amp;rsquo;s breakfast time. Upon waking up, the human stomach needs several hours to kick into high gear before it can handle complex foods such as hamburgers, celery, and pizza.</description>
