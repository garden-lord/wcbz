      <description>The obvious question that comes to mind is: &amp;ldquo;What are the three beans?&amp;rdquo; Like most things in life, there is a short answer and a long answer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while but I&amp;rsquo;m back, and with a bang. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written on some alternative uses for Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend,&amp;rdquo; but here today we have a more traditional application.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Nugget&amp;rdquo; descends from the mid 1800s word &amp;ldquo;nug,&amp;rdquo; which means lump. Gold, chicken, and even turkey have been shaped into nugget form, but until recent times, the general public has not accepted fish-based nuggets.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d have a tough time finding a kitchen these days without black pepper hiding away in the spice cabinet. Everyone has no trouble flinging salt and pepper every which way on every piece of food that passes over their countertops.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read that right, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about stuffing. I know it&amp;rsquo;s far from Thanksgiving, but sometimes in life you have to say: to heck with it.</description>

      <description>This is a little concoction of mine I discovered not long ago. Combine a microwaved can of black beans (specifically S&amp;amp;W Organic Black Beans in an 8 pack from Costco) with some Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend&amp;rdquo; and you get something heretofore unheard of.</description>

      <description>It can be tough these days to find a good Japanese soup restaurant. But fortunately, food science has progressed to the point where Japanese soups and noodle dishes can be made right in your own kitchen.</description>

      <description>Those who know me well know that I am a sucker for a nice pot of chili, for too many reasons to list out here. For just the highlights: it&amp;rsquo;s quick and it&amp;rsquo;s good.</description>

      <description>These days Gatorade comes in all shapes, colors, and sizes. I typically stick with the traditional &amp;ldquo;Thirst Quencher&amp;rdquo; line of products, which comes in dozens of flavors.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s breakfast time! And unfortunately there are no Froot Loops to be found, so we will have to settle for Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s Organic Honey Crunch n&amp;rsquo; Oats Cereal.</description>
