                        <p>&ldquo;Wagyu&rdquo; in Japanese is 和牛 which means &ldquo;Japanese cow,&rdquo; which is where Wagyu beef comes from. Wagyu cows were invented in the old times, from a specialization of the East Asian aurochs that found their way across the sea. Noted for its flavors and marbling, Wagyu has become a household name across the entire contiguous United States. Ask anyone on the street, they might be able to name only a few breeds of cattle, Wagyu and Angus among them. Wagyu is typically rated as USDA &ldquo;prime,&rdquo; as opposed to the less desirable ratings of &ldquo;select&rdquo; and &ldquo;choice.&rdquo; The grocery store hot dog aisle has a similar three-tiered rating system that is less explicit. At the base level are the hot dogs with no source specified. Take a trip to the nutrition facts and a curious consumer will find a litany of ingredients ranging from pork to sodium nitrate. A step above are the dog packs that specify their meat, such as all-beef dogs or a turkey&rsquo;s dog. At the top tier are the bun-length all-beef Angus hot dogs. These babies can crack the $6 range but for a fancy dinner the investment is worth it.</p>
<p>All my life I thought that was all there was to the world of hot dogs, but a trip to the back corner of a grocery store recently changed all that when a pack of Wagyu hot dogs caught my eye. Thick and stout these dogs promised a great deal but ultimately failed to deliver, not only wasting my time but dashing my hopes for the future of innovation in the hot dog industry.</p>

<p>Normally a hot dog&rsquo;s casing will get toasted and provide the classic hot dog &ldquo;snap,&rdquo; but on these dogs the casing&rsquo;s thickness shot off the charts, so much so that the dog-juice generated during cooking had nowhere to go. A garden-variety hot dog will sweat a little once it heats up, but these dogs stayed bone-dry, steaming their innards with their juice vapors. This led to a hard to bite exterior filled with hot dog mush. And not the good kind of hot dog mush!</p>

<p>It might look like a classic dog, but be warned: stick to the regular choices when it comes to buying hot dogs at the grocery.</p>
